<h2>Application Concept</h2>
<p>
	Our app provides information on members of the United States Congress.
</p>

<h3>Open with a joke...</h3>
<p>A thief stuck a pistol in a man’s ribs and said, “Give me your money.” The gentleman, shocked by the sudden attack, said “You cannot do this, I’m a United States congressman!” The thief said, “In that case, give me my money!”</p>

<h2>Motivation for Development</h2>
<p>
	About half of our group is passionate about politics.  In this current day, unbiased information is becoming increasingly hard to obtain.  We sought to create an application that would be useful to both novices and experts on politics.
</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>
	We started with a bare bones concept, only including The United States House of Representatives.  From there we incorperated information on campaign funding and party affiliation.  We then added Senators and included the same information for them.  With each step in the process we improved the design of the application as we learned more about Materialize and made the app easier to use as well as more aesthetically pleasing. We got a very workable version of the app done the first week and spent the rest of the time making little tweaks like adding graphs using GoogleCharts.
</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>
	Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

</p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>
	An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

</p>

<h3>Materialize</h3>
<p>
	Materialize is a UI component library created with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Materialize UI components helps in constructing attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web apps while adhering to modern web design principles like browser portability, device independence, and graceful degradation. 

</p>

<h3>JQuery</h3>
<p>
	jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

</p>

<h3>Google Maps API</h3>
<p>
	Google Maps is a web mapping service developed by Google. It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360° panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions (Google Traffic), and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation.  We used the Google Maps Embed API.  This allowed us to put a map that zooms into the area the user has entered.

</p>

<h3>Google Charts Library</h3>
<p>
	Google Charts is an interactive Web service that creates graphical charts from user-supplied information. The user supplies data and a formatting specification expressed in JavaScript embedded in a Web page; in response the service sends an image of the chart.

</p>

<h3>Propublica API</h3>
<p>
	Along with general biographical information for current and past members of Congress, the API returns data about members’ Congressional roles. Role data includes the Congress number and chamber, as well as the member’s title, state and party. A single member may have more than one role in a particular Congress (for example, the member may switch parties or move from the House to the Senate). The API also helps you compare member data, including vote positions and bill cosponsorships. Member data is available for every member who has served in Congress, but those who have served more recently (since 1995) have more information.

</p>

<h3>OpenSecrets API</h3>
<p>
	A non partisan entity Provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, tracks campaign finance donation to politicians.  notes donations from private citizens and companies as well as Super PACs and non profits.  OpenSecrets is regularly cited by new groups like Fox, CNN, Politico, and The New York Times.

</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>
	Working with the APIs, using Materialize for first time and figuring out a UI that looked nice to the group.  OpenSecret API - CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).  Getting GoogleCharts to display OpenSecret open secrets information.
</p>

<h2>Directions for Future Development</h2>
<p>
	In fututre iterrations of our application we would like to add a forums section and user authentication.  Also we would add social media API's to obtain the most recent posts from politicians.  Clickable state maps.  A comparison function. Making it mobile accessable.  Recent bills that are going to be voted on and floor actions(when a member speaks).
